access_token_secret = 'your_access_token_secret'

#authenticate with the x.com API
auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(API_KEY, api_secret, ACCESS_TOKEN, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

#set up logging
#logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
